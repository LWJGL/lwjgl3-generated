	 * 
	 * <p>A thread affinity mask is a bit vector in which each bit represents a logical processor that a thread is allowed to run on. A thread affinity mask must
	 * be a subset of the process affinity mask for the containing process of a thread. A thread can only run on the processors its process can run on.
	 * Therefore, the thread affinity mask cannot specify a 1 bit for a processor when the process affinity mask specifies a 0 bit for that processor.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Setting an affinity mask for a process or thread can result in threads receiving less processor time, as the system is restricted from running the
	 * threads on certain processors. In most cases, it is better to let the system select an available processor.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>If the new thread affinity mask does not specify the processor that is currently running the thread, the thread is rescheduled on one of the allowable
	 * processors.</p>
	 *

	 * @param threadAffinityMask the affinity mask for the thread
	 * @param __functionAddress  the DLL function address
