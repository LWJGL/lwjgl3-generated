/**
 * Instances of this interface may be set to the {@code pfnCallback} member of the {@link VkDebugReportCallbackCreateInfoEXT} struct.
 * 
 * <p>A callback will be made for issues that match any bit set in its flags. The callback will come directly from the component that detected the event,
 * unless some other layer intercepts the calls for its own purposes (filter them in different way, log to system error log, etc.) An application may
 * receive multiple callbacks if multiple {@code VkDebugReportCallbackEXT} objects were created. A callback will always be executed in the same thread as
 * the originating Vulkan call. A callback may be called from multiple threads simultaneously (if the application is making Vulkan calls from multiple
 * threads).</p>
