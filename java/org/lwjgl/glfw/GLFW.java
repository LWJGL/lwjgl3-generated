	/**
	 * Creates a window and its associated OpenGL or OpenGL ES context. Most of the options controlling how the window and its context should be created are
	 * specified with window hints.
	 * 
	 * <p>Successful creation does not change which context is current. Before you can use the newly created context, you need to make it current. For information
	 * about the {@code share} parameter, see <a href="http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/context.html#context_sharing">context sharing</a>.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>The created window, framebuffer and context may differ from what you requested, as not all parameters and hints are hard constraints. This includes the
	 * size of the window, especially for full screen windows. To query the actual attributes of the created window, framebuffer and context, use queries like
	 * {@link #glfwGetWindowAttrib GetWindowAttrib} and {@link #glfwGetWindowSize GetWindowSize} and {@link #glfwGetFramebufferSize GetFramebufferSize}.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>To create a full screen window, you need to specify the monitor the window will cover. If no monitor is specified, the window will be windowed mode.
	 * Unless you have a way for the user to choose a specific monitor, it is recommended that you pick the primary monitor. For more information on how to
	 * query connected monitors, see <a href="http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/monitor.html#monitor_monitors">monitors</a>.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>For full screen windows, the specified size becomes the resolution of the window's <i>desired video mode</i>. As long as a full screen window is not
	 * iconified, the supported video mode most closely matching the desired video mode is set for the specified monitor. For more information about full
	 * screen windows, including the creation of so called <i>windowed full screen</i> or <i>borderless full screen</i> windows, see
	 * <a href="http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window.html#window_windowed_full_screen">full screen</a>.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>By default, newly created windows use the placement recommended by the window system. To create the window at a specific position, make it initially
	 * invisible using the {@link #GLFW_VISIBLE VISIBLE} window hint, set its <a href="http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window.html#window_pos">position</a> and then
	 * <a href="http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window.html#window_hide">show</a> it.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>As long as at least one full screen window is not iconified, the screensaver is prohibited from starting.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Window systems put limits on window sizes. Very large or very small window dimensions may be overridden by the window system on creation. Check the
	 * actual <a href="http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window.html#window_size">size</a> after creation.</p>
	 *
