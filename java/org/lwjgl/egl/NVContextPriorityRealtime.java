 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/EGL/extensions/NV/EGL_NV_context_priority_realtime.txt">NV_context_priority_realtime</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>This extension allows an {@code EGLContext} to be created with one extra priority level in addition to three priority levels that are part of
 * {@code EGL_IMG_context_priority} extension.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This new level has extra privileges that are not available to other three levels. Some of the privileges may include:</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Allow realtime priority to only few contexts</li>
 * <li>Allow realtime priority only to trusted applications</li>
 * <li>Make sure realtime priority contexts are executed immediately</li>
 * <li>Preempt any current context running on GPU on submission of commands for realtime context</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The mechanism for determining which EGL context is allowed to use this priority level is platform dependent.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link IMGContextPriority IMG_context_priority}.</p>
