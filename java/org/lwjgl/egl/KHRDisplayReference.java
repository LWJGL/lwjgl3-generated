/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/egl/extensions/KHR/EGL_KHR_display_reference.txt">KHR_display_reference</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>The existing semantics of {@code EGLDisplay} object lifetimes work well for applications in which one module manages all EGL usage, and in which EGL
 * displays are expected to remain available until application termination once they are instantiated. However, EGL does not provide reasonable semantics
 * in the case where applications rely on toolkit libraries which use EGL independently from the application itself.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This issue can be solved by adding a per-{@code EGLDisplay} reference counter which is incremented by {@link EGL10#eglInitialize Initialize} calls. Resource destruction can
 * then be deferred until a corresponding number of {@link EGL10#eglTerminate Terminate} calls is made. However, switching to this behavior universally could cause backwards
 * incompatibility problems with existing applications that assume a single {@code eglTerminate} will immediately free resources regardless of how many
 * times the display has been initialized.</p>
 * 
 * <p>We therefore must support both behaviors. A new attribute specified when the {@code EGLDisplay} is obtained will indicate whether or not reference
 * counting is enabled. If an application requests the {@code EGLDisplay} multiple times with different values for this attribute, two separate displays
 * will be returned. The one potential drawaback is that these displays will have independent resource spaces, so objects allocated from one cannot be
 * used by the other. However, the goal here is to support modules that access EGL independently. In such a use case, they are not likely to need to share
 * resources with another module, particularly one that uses a different method for accessing the display.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link EXTPlatformBase EXT_platform_base} or {@link EGL15 EGL 1.5}</p>
