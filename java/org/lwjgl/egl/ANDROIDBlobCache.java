/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/EGL/extensions/ANDROID/EGL_ANDROID_blob_cache.txt">ANDROID_blob_cache</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>Shader compilation and optimization has been a troublesome aspect of OpenGL programming for a long time. It can consume seconds of CPU cycles during
 * application start-up. Additionally, state-based re-compiles done internally by the drivers add an unpredictable element to application performance
 * tuning, often leading to occasional pauses in otherwise smooth animations.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension provides a mechanism through which client API implementations may cache shader binaries after they are compiled. It may then retrieve
 * those cached shaders during subsequent executions of the same program. The management of the cache is handled by the application (or middleware),
 * allowing it to be tuned to a particular platform or environment.</p>
 * 
 * <p>While the focus of this extension is on providing a persistent cache for shader binaries, it may also be useful for caching other data. This is
 * perfectly acceptable, but the guarantees provided (or lack thereof) were designed around the shader use case.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note that although this extension is written as if the application implements the caching functionality, on the Android OS it is implemented as part of
 * the Android EGL module. This extension is not exposed to applications on Android, but will be used automatically in every application that uses EGL if
 * it is supported by the underlying device-specific EGL implementation.</p>
