/**
 * Native bindings to the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/egl/extensions/KHR/EGL_KHR_mutable_render_buffer.txt">KHR_mutable_render_buffer</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>The aim of this extension is to allow toggling of front-buffer rendering for window surfaces after their initial creation.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This allows for implementations to switch between back-buffered and single-buffered rendering without requiring re-creation of the surface. It is not
 * expected for toggling to be a frequent event.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension does not guarantee when rendering results appear on-screen. To avoid incorrect results, applications will need to use mechanisms not
 * included in this extension to synchronize rendering with the display. This functionality is not covered by this extension, and vendors are encouraged
 * to provide guidelines on how this is achieved on their implementation.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link EGL12 EGL L.1}.</p>
