     * Specifies the time at which the current color buffer of {@code surface} should be presented to the viewer. The {@code time} parameter should be a time
     * in nanoseconds, but the exact meaning of the time depends on the native window system's use of the presentation time. In situations where an absolute
     * time is needed such as displaying the color buffer on a display device, the time should correspond to the system monotonic up-time clock. For situations
     * in which an absolute time is not needed such as using the color buffer for video encoding, the presentation time of the first frame may be arbitrarily
     * chosen and those of subsequent frames chosen relative to that of the first frame.
     * 
     * <p>The presentation time may be set multiple times, with each call to {@code eglPresentationTimeANDROID} overriding prior calls. Setting the presentation
     * time alone does not cause the color buffer to be made visible, but if the color buffer is subsequently posted to a native window or copied to a native
     * pixmap then the presentation time of the surface at that time may be passed along for the native window system to use.</p>
     * 
     * <p>If the surface presentation time is successfully set, {@link EGL10#EGL_TRUE TRUE} is returned. Otherwise {@link EGL10#EGL_FALSE FALSE} is returned and an appropriate error is set. If {@code dpy}
     * is not the name of a valid, initialized {@code EGLDisplay}, an {@link EGL10#EGL_BAD_DISPLAY BAD_DISPLAY} error is generated. If {@code surface} is not a valid {@code EGLSurface}
     * then an {@link EGL10#EGL_BAD_SURFACE BAD_SURFACE} error is generated.</p>
