/**
 * Native bindings to the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/egl/extensions/EXT/EGL_EXT_buffer_age.txt">EXT_buffer_age</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>The aim of this extension is to expose enough information to applications about how the driver manages the set of front and back buffers associated
 * with a given surface to allow applications to re-use the contents of old frames and minimize how much must be redrawn for the next frame.</p>
 * 
 * <p>There are lots of different ways for a driver to manage these buffers, from double buffering, different styles of triple buffering and even n-buffering
 * or simply single buffer rendering. We also need to consider that power management events or memory pressure events might also result in some of the
 * buffers not currently in-use being freed.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension lets applications query the age of the back buffer contents for an EGL surface as the number of frames elapsed since the contents were
 * most recently defined. The back buffer can either be reported as invalid (has an age of 0) or it may be reported to contain the contents from n frames
 * prior to the current frame.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Once the application has queried the buffer age, the age of contents remains valid until the end of the frame for all pixels that continue to pass the
 * pixel ownership test.</p>
 * 
 * <p>For many use-cases this extension can provide an efficient alternative to using the EGL_BUFFER_PRESERVED swap behaviour. The EGL_BUFFER_PRESERVED swap
 * behaviour adds a direct dependency for any frame n on frame n - 1 which can affect the pipelining of multiple frames but also implies a costly
 * copy-back of data to initialize the back-buffer at the start of each frame.</p>
 * 
 * <p>For example if you consider a double buffered application drawing a small spinning icon, but everything else in the scene is static. If we know that 2
 * buffers are continuously being recycled each time eglSwapBuffers is called then even though 100s of frames may need to be drawn to animate the icon it
 * can be seen that the two buffers are remaining unchanged except within the bounds of the icon. In this scenario ideally the application would simply
 * perform an incremental update of the old buffer instead of redundantly redrawing all the static parts of the scene. The problem up until now though has
 * been that EGL doesn't report how buffers may be recycled so it wasn't safe for applications to try and reuse their contents. Now applications can keep
 * track of all the regions that have changed over the last n frames and by knowing the age of the buffer they know how to efficiently repair buffers that
 * are re-cycled instead of redrawing the entire scene.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link EGL14 EGL L.1}.</p>
