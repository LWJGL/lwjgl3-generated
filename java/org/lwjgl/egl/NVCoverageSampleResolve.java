/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/egl/extensions/NV/EGL_NV_coverage_sample_resolve.txt">NV_coverage_sample_resolve</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>NV_coverage_sample introduced a method to improve rendering quality using a separate buffer to store coverage information for pixels in the color
 * buffers. It also provided a mechanism to disable writing to the coverage buffer when coverage sample filtering was not needed or undesirable. However,
 * it did not provide a way to disable reading data from the coverage buffer at resolve time. In some cases performance can be improved by eliminating
 * these memory reads. To that end, this extension exposes a surface attribute that allows applications to specify when no coverage sample resolve is
 * desired.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link EGL12 EGL 1.2}.</p>
