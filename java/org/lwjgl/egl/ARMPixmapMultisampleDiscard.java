/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/EGL/extensions/ARM/EGL_ARM_pixmap_multisample_discard.txt">ARM_pixmap_multisample_discard</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>ARM_pixmap_multisample_discard adds an attribute to eglCreatePixmapSurface that allows the client API implementation to resolve a multisampled pixmap
 * surface, therefore allowing the multisample buffer to be discarded.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Some GPU architectures - such as tile-based renderers - are capable of performing multisampled rendering by storing multisample data in internal
 * high-speed memory and downsampling the data when writing out to external memory after rendering has finished. Since per-sample data is never written
 * out to external memory, this approach saves bandwidth and storage space. In this case multisample data gets discarded, however this is acceptable in
 * most cases.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The extension provides the EGL_DISCARD_SAMPLES_ARM attribute that allows for implicit resolution when rendering to a pixmap surface. This complements
 * the OpenGL ES EXT_multisampled_render_to_texture extension which provides similar functionality for rendering to an OpenGL ES texture.</p>
