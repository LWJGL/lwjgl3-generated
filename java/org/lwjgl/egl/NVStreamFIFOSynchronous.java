/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/egl/extensions/NV/EGL_NV_stream_fifo_synchronous.txt">NV_stream_fifo_synchronous</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>On platforms which support asynchronous rendering, frames may be inserted into a stream by the producer and become available to the consumer before
 * rendering of the images has completed. When this happens, commands issued by the consumer which read from the image must implicitly wait before they
 * can be executed. In many use cases, this is desirable behavior. Rendering pipelines are kept full, and frames are created and processed as fast as
 * possible.</p>
 * 
 * <p>However, in the case of a compositor which is consuming frames from multiple producers at once, combining them into a single output image, this can
 * slow the compositor to the frame rate of the slowest producer. If the application acquires and uses an image from one producer which requires a long
 * time to finish rendering, it will be prevented from presenting new frames from faster producers in a timely fashion. In this case, the compositor would
 * prefer to reuse an older frame from the slower producer until the new one is ready.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This could be handled with existing interfaces by the producer issuing appropriate Finish call before inserting the frame into the stream. However this
 * requires the producer to have knowledge of the consumer's use case, and also introduces undesirable bubbles into the producer's pipeline which will
 * slow it even further.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension allows streams to be configured to defer the availability of new frames inserted by the producer until they are ready to be used. The
 * producer proceeds as normal, but the frames visible to the consumer through query and acquire operations do not update immediately.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Interactions of this feature with a stream operating in mailbox mode would be hard to define. Because newly inserted frames replace previous unacquired
 * ones, it is possible that the consumer would never see a completed frame become available. Therefore this feature is only available for streams
 * operating in FIFO mode.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link KHRStreamFIFO KHR_stream_fifo}.</p>
