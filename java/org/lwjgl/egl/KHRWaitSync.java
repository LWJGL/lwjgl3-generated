/**
 * Native bindings to the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/egl/extensions/KHR/EGL_KHR_wait_sync.txt">KHR_wait_sync</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>This extension adds the ability to wait for signaling of sync objects in the server for a client API context, rather than in the application thread
 * bound to that context. This form of wait does not necessarily block the application thread which issued the wait (unlike eglClientWaitSyncKHR), so the
 * application may continue to issue commands to the client API context or perform other work in parallel, leading to increased performance. The best
 * performance is likely to be achieved by implementations which can perform this new wait operation in GPU hardware, although this is not required.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link EGL11 EGL 1.1} and {@link KHRFenceSync KHR_fence_sync}.</p>
