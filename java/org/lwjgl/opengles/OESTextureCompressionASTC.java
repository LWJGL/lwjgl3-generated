 * 
 * <p>Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression (ASTC) is a new texture compression technology that offers unprecendented flexibility, while producing better or
 * comparable results than existing texture compressions at all bit rates. It includes support for 2D and 3D textures, with low and high dynamic range, at
 * bitrates from below 1 bit/pixel up to 8 bits/pixel in fine steps.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The goal of this extension is to support the full profile of the ASTC texture compression specification.</p>
 * 
 * <p>ASTC-compressed textures are handled in OpenGL ES and OpenGL by adding new supported formats to the existing mechanisms for handling compressed
 * textures.</p>
 * 
 * <h3>What is ASTC</h3>
 * 
 * <p>ASTC stands for Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression. The ASTC formats form a family of related compressed texture image formats. They are all derived
 * from a common set of definitions.</p>
 * 
 * <p>ASTC textures may be either 2D or 3D.</p>
 * 
 * <p>ASTC textures may be encoded using either high or low dynamic range. Low dynamic range images may optionally be specified using the sRGB color space.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Two sub-profiles ("LDR Profile" and "HDR Profile") may be implemented, which support only 2D images at low or high dynamic range respectively. The LDR
 * profile is indicated by the presence of only the extension string "GL_KHR_texture_compression_astc_ldr". If the HDR profile is implemented, both
 * "GL_KHR_texture_compression_astc_ldr" and "GL_KHR_texture_compression_astc_hdr" must be published. If the full profile (including 3D textures) is
 * implemented, then all three extension strings "GL_KHR_texture_compression_astc_ldr", "GL_KHR_texture_compression_astc_hdr" and
 * "GL_OES_texture_compression_astc" must be published.</p>
 * 
 * <p>ASTC textures may be encoded as 1, 2, 3 or 4 components, but they are all decoded into RGBA.</p>
 * 
 * <p>ASTC has a variable block size, and this is specified as part of the name of the token passed to CompressedImage2D and its related functions.</p>
