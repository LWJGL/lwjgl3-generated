/**
 * Native bindings to the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/extensions/OES/OES_vertex_half_float.txt">OES_vertex_half_float</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>This extension adds a 16-bit floating pt data type (aka half float) to vertex data specified using vertex arrays. The 16-bit floating-point components
 * have 1 sign bit, 5 exponent bits, and 10 mantissa bits.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The half float data type can be very useful in specifying vertex attribute data such as color, normals, texture coordinates etc. By using half floats
 * instead of floats, we reduce the memory requirements by half. Not only does the memory footprint reduce by half, but the memory bandwidth required for
 * vertex transformations also reduces by the same amount approximately. Another advantage of using half floats over short/byte data types is that we do
 * not needto scale the data. For example, using SHORT for texture coordinates implies that we need to scale the input texture coordinates in the shader
 * or set an appropriate scale matrix as the texture matrix for fixed function pipeline. Doing these additional scaling operations impacts vertex
 * transformation performance.</p>
