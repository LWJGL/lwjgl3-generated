 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/extensions/KHR/no_error.txt">KHR_no_error</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>With this extension enabled any behavior that generates a GL error will have undefined behavior. The reason this extension exists is performance can be
 * increased and power usage decreased. When this mode is used, a GL driver can have undefined behavior where it would have generated a GL error without
 * this extension. This could include application termination. In general this extension should be used after you have verified all the GL errors are
 * removed, and an application is not the kind that would check for GL errors and adjust behavior based on those errors.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link GLES20 GLES 2.0}.</p>
