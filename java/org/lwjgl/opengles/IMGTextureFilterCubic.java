/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/extensions/IMG/IMG_texture_filter_cubic.txt">IMG_texture_filter_cubic</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>OpenGL ES provides two sampling methods available; nearest neighbor or linear filtering, with optional MIP Map sampling modes added to move between
 * differently sized textures when downsampling.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension adds an additional, high quality cubic filtering mode, using a Catmull-Rom bicubic filter. Performing this kind of filtering can be done
 * in a shader by using 16 samples, but this can be inefficient. The cubic filter mode exposes an optimized high quality texture sampling using fixed
 * functionality.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension affects the way textures are sampled, by modifying the way texels within the same MIP-Map level are sampled and resolved. It does not
 * affect MIP-Map filtering, which is still limited to linear or nearest.</p>
