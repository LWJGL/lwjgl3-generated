/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/extensions/APPLE/rgb_422.txt">APPLE_rgb_422</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>A common storage format for video data is 8-bit 422, with every four bytes encoding two pixels. Within the four bytes there are two luminance samples,
 * and two chrominance samples that are shared between both pixels.</p>
 * 
 * <p>There is a previous extension, namely GL_APPLE_ycbcr_422 that provided transparent support for this kind of data. However, that extension left the
 * exact conversion from Y'CbCr to RGB undefined. In reality, it really had always been based on the ITU-R BT.601 standard, which meant it was not
 * particularly useful for dealing with high definition video data, which is encoded using the Rec. 709 standard.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In some cases the original extension was implemented via fixed function hardware, but on more modern graphics processors this is done via a combination
 * of 422 sampling formats and fragment shader instructions.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension essentially exposes a "raw" 422 texture format that allows developers to access the raw pre-converted Y'CbCr components so that they
 * have full control over the colorspace conversion.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In order to avoid defining entirely new color channels within GL, the Y, Cb and Cr color channels within the 422 data are mapped into the existing
 * green, blue and red color channels, respectively. Developers must write their own fragment shader/program to perform the desired color space
 * transformation.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note: Because of the use of the packed UNSIGNED_SHORT_8_8[_REV] types, the correct type to use based on the layout of the data in memory (Cb Y Cr Y
 * versus Y Cb Y Cr) will necessarily be sensitive to host endianness.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension differs from the EXT_422_pixels extension in a couple of ways. First, this extension defines only a single new format, while relying on
 * two new type arguments to differentiate between the two component orderings. Second, this extension provides no defined method of filtering the chroma
 * values between adjacent pixels. And lastly, the color channel assignments are slightly different, essentially to match more closely the rough meanings
 * of the Y, Cb and Cr values in 422 video data.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link GLES20 GLES 2.0}.</p>
