/**
 * Native bindings to the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/extensions/NV/NV_instanced_arrays.txt">NV_instanced_arrays</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>A common use case in GL for some applications is to be able to draw the same object, or groups of similar objects that share vertex data, primitive
 * count and type, multiple times. This extension provides a means of accelerating such use cases while limiting the number of required API calls, and
 * keeping the amount of duplicate data to a minimum.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In particular, this extension specifies an alternative to the read-only shader variable introduced by NV_draw_instanced. It uses the same draw calls
 * introduced by that extension, but redefines them so that a vertex shader can instead use vertex array attributes as a source of instance data.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension introduces an array "divisor" for generic vertex array attributes, which when non-zero specifies that the attribute is "instanced." An
 * instanced attribute does not advance per-vertex as usual, but rather after every {@code divisor} conceptual draw calls.</p>
 * 
 * <p>(Attributes which aren't instanced are repeated in their entirety for every conceptual draw call.)</p>
 * 
 * <p>By specifying transform data in an instanced attribute or series of instanced attributes, vertex shaders can, in concert with the instancing draw
 * calls, draw multiple instances of an object with one draw call.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link GLES20 GLES 2.0}.</p>
