 * 
 * <p>Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression (ASTC) is a texture compression technology that is exposed by existing extensions and specifications.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The existing specifications require that low dynamic range (LDR) textures are decompressed to FP16 values per component. In many cases, decompressing
 * LDR textures to a lower precision intermediate result gives acceptable image quality. Source material for LDR textures is typically authored as 8-bit
 * UNORM values, so decoding to FP16 values adds little value. On the other hand, reducing precision of the decoded result reduces the size of the
 * decompressed data, potentially improving texture cache performance and saving power.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The goal of this extension is to enable this efficiency gain on existing ASTC texture data. This is achieved by giving the application the ability to
 * select the decoding precision.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Two decoding options are provided by {@code GL_EXT_texture_compression_astc_decode_mode}:</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Decode to FP16: This is the default, and matches the required behavior in existing APIs.</li>
 * <li>Decode to UNORM8: This is provided as an option in LDR mode.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>If {@code GL_EXT_texture_compression_astc_decode_mode_rgb9e5} is supported, then a third decoding option is provided:</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Decode to {@link GLES30#GL_RGB9_E5 RGB9_E5}: This is provided as an option in both LDR and HDR mode. In this mode, negative values cannot be represented and are clamped to
 * zero. The alpha component is ignored, and the results are as if alpha was 1.0.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link GLES30 GLES 3.0}.</p>
