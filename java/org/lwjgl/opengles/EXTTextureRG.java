/**
 * Native bindings to the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/extensions/EXT/EXT_texture_rg.txt">EXT_texture_rg</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>Historically one- and two-component textures have been specified in OpenGL ES using the luminance or luminance-alpha (L/LA) formats. With the advent of
 * programmable shaders and render-to-texture capabilities these legacy formats carry some historical artifacts which are no longer useful.</p>
 * 
 * <p>For example, when sampling from such textures, the luminance values are replicated across the color components. This is no longer necessary with
 * programmable shaders.</p>
 * 
 * <p>It is also desirable to be able to render to one- and two-component format textures using capabilities such as framebuffer objects (FBO), but rendering
 * to L/LA formats is under-specified (specifically how to map R/G/B/A values to L/A texture channels).</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension adds new base internal formats for one-component RED and two-component RG (red green) textures as well as sized RED and RG internal
 * formats for renderbuffers. The RED and RG texture formats can be used for both texturing and rendering into with framebuffer objects.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link GLES20 GLES 2.0}.</p>
