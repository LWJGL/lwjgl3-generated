/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/extensions/ANGLE/ANGLE_pack_reverse_row_order.txt">ANGLE_pack_reverse_row_order</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>This extension introduces a mechanism to allow reversing the order in which image rows are written into a pack destination. This effectively allows an
 * application to flip the results of a ReadPixels in the y direction operation without having to render upside down.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The coordinate system of OpenGL is vertically reversed in comparison to a number of other graphics systems such as native windowing APIs. Applications
 * that perform ReadPixels may have to either render to an intermediate color buffer before calling ReadPixels or perform a flip in software after
 * ReadPixels. In some systems the GL can perform the row reversal during ReadPixels without incurring additional cost.</p>
