/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/extensions/intel/cl_intel_planar_yuv.txt">intel_planar_yuv</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>The purpose of this extension is to provide OpenCL support for the Planar YUV (YCbCr) image formats. {@link #CL_NV12_INTEL NV12_INTEL} format must be supported; support for
 * other Planar YUV formats that may be defined in this extension is optional.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The extension introduces two new cl_mem_flags:</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #CL_MEM_NO_ACCESS_INTEL MEM_NO_ACCESS_INTEL} which should be used together with image formats for which device does not support reading from or writing to at OpenCL
 * kernels level, but are still useful in other use cases.</li>
 * <li>{@link #CL_MEM_ACCESS_FLAGS_UNRESTRICTED_INTEL MEM_ACCESS_FLAGS_UNRESTRICTED_INTEL} which may be used to relax the memory access rights specified in {@code cl_mem_flags} at memory object
 * creation time and allow to access and modify the contents of the underlying data storage in unrestricted way e.g. by creating another memory object
 * from that memory object or using dedicated device mechanisms.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link CL12 CL12}.</p>
