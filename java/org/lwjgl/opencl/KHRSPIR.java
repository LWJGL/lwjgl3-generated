 * 
 * <h3>Compiler Options</h3>
 * 
 * <p>The compile option {@code -x spir} must be specified to indicate that the binary is in SPIR format, and the compile option {@code -spir-std} must be
 * used to specify the version of the SPIR specification that describes the format and meaning of the binary. For example, if the binary is as described
 * in SPIR version 1.2, then {@code -spir-std=1.2} must be specified. Failing to specify these compile options may result in implementation defined
 * behavior.</p>
