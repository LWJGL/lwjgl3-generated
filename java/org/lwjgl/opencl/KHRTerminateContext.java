/**
 * Native bindings to the <strong>khr_terminate_context</strong> extension.
 * 
 * <p>OpenCL provides an API to release a context. This operation is done only after all queues, memory object, programs and kernels are released, which in
 * turn might wait for all ongoing operations to complete. However, there are cases in which a fast release is required, or release operation cannot be
 * done, as commands are stuck in mid execution. An example of the first case can be program termination due to exception, or quick shutdown due to low
 * power. Examples of the second case are when a kernel is running too long, or gets stuck, or it may result from user action which makes the results of
 * the computation unnecessary.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In many cases, the driver or the device is capable of speeding up the closure of ongoing operations when the results are no longer required in a much
 * more expedient manner than waiting for all previously enqueued operations to finish.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension implements a new query to check whether a device can terminate an OpenCL context and adds an API to terminate a context.</p>

	 * Terminates all pending work associated with the context and renders all data owned by the context invalid. It is the responsibility of the application

	 * 
	 * <p>When a context is terminated:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>The execution status of enqueued commands will be {@link #CL_TERMINATED_KHR TERMINATED_KHR}. Event objects can be queried using {@link CL10#clGetEventInfo GetEventInfo}. Event
	 * callbacks can be registered and registered event callbacks will be called with {@code event_command_exec_status} set to {@link #CL_TERMINATED_KHR TERMINATED_KHR}.
	 * {@link CL10#clWaitForEvents WaitForEvents} will return immediately for commands associated with event objects specified in {@code event_list}. The status of user
	 * events can be set. Event objects can be retained and released. {@link CL10#clGetEventProfilingInfo GetEventProfilingInfo} returns {@link CL10#CL_PROFILING_INFO_NOT_AVAILABLE PROFILING_INFO_NOT_AVAILABLE}.</li>
	 * <li>The context is considered to be terminated. A callback function registered when the context was created will be called. Only queries, retain and
	 * release operations can be performed on the context. All other APIs that use a context as an argument will return {@link #CL_CONTEXT_TERMINATED_KHR CONTEXT_TERMINATED_KHR}.</li>
	 * <li>The contents of the memory regions of the memory objects is undefined. Queries, registering a destructor callback, retain and release operations can
	 * be performed on the memory objects.</li>
	 * <li>Once a context has been terminated, all OpenCL API calls that create objects or enqueue commands will return {@link #CL_CONTEXT_TERMINATED_KHR CONTEXT_TERMINATED_KHR}. APIs
	 * that release OpenCL objects will continue to operate as though {@code clTerminateContextKHR} was not called.</li>
	 * <li>The behavior of callbacks will remain unchanged, and will report appropriate error, if executing after termination of context. This behavior is
	 * similar to enqueued commands, after the command queue has become invalid.</li>
	 * </ul></p>
