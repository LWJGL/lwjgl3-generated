	 * 
	 * <p>If {@link #CL_MEM_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_BUFFER MEM_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_BUFFER} is not specified, the buffer can be created as a coarse grained SVM allocation. Similarly, if

	 * 
	 * <p>Calling {@code SVMAlloc} does not itself provide consistency for the shared memory region. When the host can't use the SVM atomic operations, it must
	 * rely on OpenCL's guaranteed memory consistency at synchronization points. To initialize a buffer to be shared with a kernel, the host can create the
	 * buffer and use the resulting virtual memory pointer to initialize the buffer's contents.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>For SVM to be used efficiently, the host and any devices sharing a buffer containing virtual memory pointers should have the same endianness. If the
	 * context passed to {@code SVMAlloc} has devices with mixed endianness and the OpenCL implementation is unable to implement SVM because of that mixed
	 * endianness, {@code SVMAlloc} will fail and return {@code NULL}.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Although SVM is generally not supported for image objects, {@link CL12#clCreateImage CreateImage} may create an image from a buffer (a 1D image from a buffer
	 * or a 2D image from buffer) if the buffer specified in its image description parameter is a SVM buffer. Such images have a linear memory representation
	 * so their memory can be shared using SVM. However, fine grained sharing and atomics are not supported for image reads and writes in a kernel.</p>

	 * 
	 * <p>1. Coarse-grain or fine-grain buffer SVM pointers used by a kernel which are not passed as a kernel arguments must be specified using
	 * {@code SetKernelExecInfo} with {@link #CL_KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_PTRS KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_PTRS}. For example, if SVM buffer A contains a pointer to another SVM buffer B, and the
	 * kernel dereferences that pointer, then a pointer to B must either be passed as an argument in the call to that kernel or it must be made available to
	 * the kernel using {@code SetKernelExecInfo}. For example, we might pass extra SVM pointers as follows:</p>
	 * 
	 * <p><code>clSetKernelExecInfo(kernel, CL_KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_PTRS, num_ptrs * sizeof(void *), extra_svm_ptr_list);</code></p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Here {@code num_ptrs} specifies the number of additional SVM pointers while {@code extra_svm_ptr_list} specifies a pointer to memory containing those
	 * SVM pointers. When calling {@code SetKernelExecInfo} with {@link #CL_KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_PTRS KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_PTRS} to specify pointers to non-argument SVM buffers as extra
	 * arguments to a kernel, each of these pointers can be the SVM pointer returned by {@link #clSVMAlloc SVMAlloc} or can be a pointer + offset into the SVM region. It is
	 * sufficient to provide one pointer for each SVM buffer used.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>2. {@link #CL_KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_SYSTEM KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_SYSTEM} is used to indicate whether SVM pointers used by a kernel will refer to system allocations or not.</p>

	 * Can be used to pass additional information other than argument values to a kernel.
	 * 
	 * <p>NOTES</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>1. Coarse-grain or fine-grain buffer SVM pointers used by a kernel which are not passed as a kernel arguments must be specified using
	 * {@code SetKernelExecInfo} with {@link #CL_KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_PTRS KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_PTRS}. For example, if SVM buffer A contains a pointer to another SVM buffer B, and the
	 * kernel dereferences that pointer, then a pointer to B must either be passed as an argument in the call to that kernel or it must be made available to
	 * the kernel using {@code SetKernelExecInfo}. For example, we might pass extra SVM pointers as follows:</p>
	 * 
	 * <p><code>clSetKernelExecInfo(kernel, CL_KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_PTRS, num_ptrs * sizeof(void *), extra_svm_ptr_list);</code></p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Here {@code num_ptrs} specifies the number of additional SVM pointers while {@code extra_svm_ptr_list} specifies a pointer to memory containing those
	 * SVM pointers. When calling {@code SetKernelExecInfo} with {@link #CL_KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_PTRS KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_PTRS} to specify pointers to non-argument SVM buffers as extra
	 * arguments to a kernel, each of these pointers can be the SVM pointer returned by {@link #clSVMAlloc SVMAlloc} or can be a pointer + offset into the SVM region. It is
	 * sufficient to provide one pointer for each SVM buffer used.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>2. {@link #CL_KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_SYSTEM KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_SYSTEM} is used to indicate whether SVM pointers used by a kernel will refer to system allocations or not.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>{@link #CL_KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_SYSTEM KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_SYSTEM} = {@link CL10#CL_FALSE FALSE} indicates that the OpenCL implementation may assume that system pointers are not passed as
	 * kernel arguments and are not stored inside SVM allocations passed as kernel arguments.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>{@link #CL_KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_SYSTEM KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_SYSTEM} = {@link CL10#CL_TRUE TRUE} indicates that the OpenCL implementation must assume that system pointers might be passed as
	 * kernel arguments and/or stored inside SVM allocations passed as kernel arguments. In this case, if the device to which the kernel is enqueued does not
	 * support system SVM pointers, {@link CL10#clEnqueueNDRangeKernel EnqueueNDRangeKernel} will return a {@link CL10#CL_INVALID_OPERATION INVALID_OPERATION} error. If none of the devices in the context
	 * associated with kernel support fine-grain system SVM allocations, {@code SetKernelExecInfo} will return a {@link CL10#CL_INVALID_OPERATION INVALID_OPERATION} error.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>If {@code SetKernelExecInfo} has not been called with a value for {@link #CL_KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_SYSTEM KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_SYSTEM}, the default value is used for this
	 * kernel attribute. The default value depends on whether the device on which the kernel is enqueued supports fine-grain system SVM allocations. If so, the
	 * default value used is {@link CL10#CL_TRUE TRUE} (system pointers might be passed); otherwise, the default is {@link CL10#CL_FALSE FALSE}.</p>
	 *
	 * @param kernel      the kernel object being queried
	 * @param param_name  the information to be passed to {@code kernel}. One of:<br><table><tr><td>{@link #CL_KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_PTRS KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_PTRS}</td><td>{@link #CL_KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_SYSTEM KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_SYSTEM}</td></tr></table>
	 * @param param_value a pointer to memory where the appropriate values determined by {@code param_name} are specified
