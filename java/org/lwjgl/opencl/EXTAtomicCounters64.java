 * 
 * <p>This extension adds support in the OpenCL C language for 64-bit atomic counters. Atomic counter is a device-level counter that can be added /
 * decremented by work-items in a work-group or across work-groups executing a kernel, where the atomicity of the operation is guaranteed. The access to
 * the counter is done only via add/dec built-in functions, and as such no two workitems will see the same value returned in the case that a given kernel
 * only increments or decrements the counter.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This feature is highly useful for produce/consume to unordered queues.</p>
