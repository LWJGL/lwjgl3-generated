/**
 * Native bindings to the <a href="http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/NV/fence.txt">NV_fence</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>The goal of this extension is provide a finer granularity of synchronizing GL command completion than offered by standard OpenGL, which offers only two
 * mechanisms for synchronization: Flush and Finish. Since Flush merely assures the user that the commands complete in a finite (though undetermined)
 * amount of time, it is, thus, of only modest utility. Finish, on the other hand, stalls CPU execution until all pending GL commands have completed. This
 * extension offers a middle ground - the ability to "finish" a subset of the command stream, and the ability to determine whether a given command has
 * completed or not.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension introduces the concept of a "fence" to the OpenGL command stream. Once the fence is inserted into the command stream, it can be queried
 * for a given condition - typically, its completion. Moreover, the application may also request a partial Finish -- that is, all commands prior to the
 * fence will be forced to complete until control is returned to the calling process. These new mechanisms allow for synchronization between the host CPU
 * and the GPU, which may be accessing the same resources (typically memory).</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension is useful in conjunction with NV_vertex_array_range to determine when vertex information has been pulled from the vertex array range.
 * Once a fence has been tested TRUE or finished, all vertex indices issued before the fence must have been pulled. This ensures that the vertex data
 * memory corresponding to the issued vertex indices can be safely modified (assuming no other outstanding vertex indices are issued subsequent to the
 * fence).</p>
