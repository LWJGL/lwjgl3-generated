/**
 * Native bindings to the <strong>altera_live_object_tracking</strong> extension.
 * 
 * <p>This extension specifies an API for debugging OpenCL API object leaks in user applications. It provides a mechanism for tracking all live API objects,
 * and for enumerating them on demand.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The OpenCL runtime API generates and uses many kinds of objects such as contexts, programs, kernels, memory objects, command queues, and events.</p>
 * 
 * <p>It is very easy for an application to lose track of what objects it has created but not yet fully released. Forgetting to fully release an object after
 * use may result in undesirable behaviour, such as increased memory use or even command scheduler lockup. This problem gets much worse when new objects
 * leak each time through an application loop.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension defines two runtime API methods.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The first method specifies a future interest in enumerating all the live objects in the runtime API. Live object tracking is a debugging feature which
 * may increase memory use and runtime of the application. So it should be explicitly requested.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Ideally, the request to begin tracking live objects should occur as early as possible in the program, so that no leaked objects escape undetected.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The second method requests an enumeration of those objects via a callback mechanism.</p>
