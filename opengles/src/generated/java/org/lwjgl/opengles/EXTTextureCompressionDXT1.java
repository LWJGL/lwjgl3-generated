 * <p>Support of EXT_texture_compression_s3tc is attractive for OpenGL-ES implementations because it provides compressed textures that allow for
 * significantly reduced texture storage. Reducing texture storage is advantageous because of the smaller memory capacity of many embedded systems
 * compared to desktop systems. Smaller textures also provide a welcome performance advantage since embedded platforms typically provide less performance
 * than desktop systems. S3TC compressed textures are widely supported and used by applications. The DXT1 format is used in the vast majority of cases in
 * which S3TC compressed textures are used.</p>
 * 
 * <p>However, EXT_texture_compression_s3tc specifies functionality that is burdensome for an OpenGL-ES implementation. In particular it requires that the
 * driver provide the capability to compress textures into S3TC texture formats, as an S3TC texture format is accepted as the {@code internalformat}
 * parameter of TexImage2D and CopyTexImage2D. Further, EXT_texture_compression_s3tc may require conversion from one S3TC format to another during
 * CompressedTexSubImage2D if the {@code format} parameter does not match the <internalformat> of the texture image previously created by TexImage2D.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In an OpenGL-ES implementation it is therefore advantageous to support a limited subset of EXT_texture_compression_s3tc: Restrict supported texture
 * formats to DXT1 and restrict supported operations to those that do not require texture compression into an S3TC texture format or decompression from an
 * S3TC texture format.</p>
