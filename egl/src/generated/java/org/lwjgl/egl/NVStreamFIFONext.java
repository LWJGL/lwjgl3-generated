/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/EGL/extensions/NV/EGL_NV_stream_fifo_next.txt">NV_stream_fifo_next</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>When operating on a FIFO stream, a consumer may need to know the timestamp associated with the next frame in the stream before deciding whether to
 * acquire it or reuse the previous frame. In the case of a FIFO size of 1, the {@link KHRStreamFIFO#EGL_STREAM_TIME_PRODUCER_KHR STREAM_TIME_PRODUCER_KHR} attribute is sufficient to determine this.
 * However, when the size is greater than 1, there may be frames available with earlier time stamps than the one most recently inserted by the producer.
 * This extension enables querying of the next pending frame in a stream.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link KHRStreamFIFO KHR_stream_fifo}.</p>
